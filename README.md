# RedwoodJS Page Redesign



## Some general considerations

* All markup and styles need to be within the component
* Shouldn’t rely on TailwindCss
* Supports Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc.
* Quick to load, so relatively lightweight
* Friendly, engaging, exciting
* Reflects mission and sentiment from [Docs - Introduction : RedwoodJS Docs](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/introduction)


Open to new animation, mascot/characters, helpful links to resources … be creative!
